# extra_print

### ```p``` all the things
### or in this case ```ep``` all the things!

_extra_print_ is a simple Ruby Gem designed to make locating specific lines of output in the terminal easier. This is achieved by inserting headers and footers around a given variable, or by displaying a line of emojis to act as a standalone line break.

Extra print was built with JR web developers in mind. Hopefully this gem helps build a healthy habit around verifying the evaluation of your code instead of frequently making false assumptions around a programs state. That said, I've been programming for some time and I love highly visible debugging statements so....... maybe something about geese and ganders.

Extra print is a fork of an idea originally put together by Dev Bootcamp grad Shawn Watson with his [attn_rubygem](https://github.com/its-swats/attn_rubygem).

## Installation
```bash
dev :> gem install extra_print
```

## Usage
It's as simple as requiring the gem in your project. Once required, extra_print has 2 modes, and a handful of colorization options.

Require the gem in your file
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> require 'extra_print'
```

### Variable Display

Pass a variable as the first argument to see it displayed like this

```ruby
irb(main):008:0> ep(Variable_to_highlight)
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†  FINISH â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```

### Variable Display with footer message

You can also specify a message as a second argument (string) to be displayed in the footer. Easily identifying multiple extra_print calls.

```ruby
irb(main):010:0> ep(Variable_to_highlight, 'thing from that place')
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† thing from that place â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```

### Line Break

Call the method without any arguments to insert a line of random emojis
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> ep
ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ
```

This can be incredibly helpful when you need to know if you made it to a particular line of code, like say inside some conditional. A standard p statement gets lost in 1000 lines of server logs but and extra_print statement stands out.


### Awesome Variable Display

Call ```eap``` instead of ```ep``` for __EXTRA AWESOME PRINT__ to display your variable using awesome_print. All above functionality works exactly the same.

```ruby
irb(main):010:0> eap(some_hash_variable, 'some hash')

â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Hash LENGTH: 1 CALLER: sandbox.rb:30:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

{
    :thing => "stuff"
}

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†  some hash â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```
