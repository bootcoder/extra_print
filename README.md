# extra_print
### a gem to catch the eye

_extra_print_ is a simple Ruby Gem designed to make locating specific lines of output in the terminal easier. This is achieved by inserting headers and footers around a given variable, or by displaying a line of emojis to act as a standalone line break. Extra print is a fork of an idea originally put together by Shawn Watson with [attn_rubygem](https://github.com/its-swats/attn_rubygem).

## Installation
```
dev :> gem install extra_print
```

## Usage
It's as simple as requiring the gem in your project. Once required, extra_print has 2 modes, and a handful of colorization options.

Require the gem in your file
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> require 'extra_print'
```

### Line Break

Call the method without any arguments to insert a line of random emojis
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> ep
ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ
```

### Variable Display

Pass a variable as the first argument to see it displayed like this

```ruby
irb(main):008:0> ep(Variable_to_highlight)
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†  FINISH â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```

### Variable Display with message

You can also specify a message as a second argument (string) to be displayed in the footer. Easily identifying multiple extra_print calls.

```ruby

irb(main):010:0> ep(Variable_to_highlight, 'thing from that place')
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† thing from that place â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```
